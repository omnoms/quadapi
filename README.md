QuadAPI swagger definition

I grew tired of not having enough information regarding the quad parts that I purchase, so a step on the way is to first define the parameters that we would like to know regarding each part, then make the API and publicly available and hopefully the community can together source bits and pieces together to make the database fully fledged.

Like, what's the clearance in the frame for the stack? What stack height does it allow? What kind of mounting holes does the frame have? What size props does it support? Does it allow for a top or bottom mounted battery? Does it have dedicated battery-strap flanges? All kinds of questions...
